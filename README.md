# Pizza Sales
In this project, we dive into pizza sales data, aiming to extract valuable insights into sales trends and customer preferences. We start by analyzing various metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and total orders placed.

## Key Metrics:
**Total Revenue:** We calculate the overall revenue generated from pizza sales.
**Average Order Value:** This metric provides insight into the average spending per order.
**Total Pizzas Sold:** We determine the total quantity of pizzas sold.
**Total Orders:** The count of unique orders placed.
**Average Pizzas Per Order:** Calculating the average number of pizzas ordered per transaction.

## Trend Analysis:
We then delve into analyzing trends over time, examining daily, hourly, and monthly variations in total orders. Understanding these trends can offer valuable insights into peak ordering periods and customer behavior.

## Sales Composition:
Further, we explore the composition of sales by pizza category and size, identifying the most popular choices among customers. This analysis helps in understanding customer preferences and optimizing product offerings.

## Top Sellers:
We identify the top-selling pizzas based on total revenue, quantity sold, and total orders. Additionally, we uncover the least performing pizzas to identify areas for improvement.

## Conclusion:
By conducting comprehensive analyses and exploring various facets of pizza sales data, we aim to provide actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction.
